## MLOps News Data Classification NLP Model
MLOps Project for NLP Model with Data from AG News is a collection of more than 1 million news articles gathered from more than 2000 news sources by an academic news search engine


- ## Part 1:
  - Project: machine learning text classifier to predict news categories from the news article text.
    - Iterated on classification models with increasing level of complexity and improved performance
    - Analyzed the impact of training data size on model performance

- ## Part 2:
  - Project: detailed model evaluation, data quality testing, and behavioral testing for the news classification model from part 1
    - Analyzed evaluation metrics beyond overall accuracy and f1 score (per-class metrics, confusion matrix, per-class false positive and false negative errors)
    - Implemented bootstrap sampling to measure confidence intervals of model performance metrics
    -  Implemented behavioral tests using a popular open source library called checklist
